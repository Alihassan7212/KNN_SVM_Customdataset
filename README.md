# KNN_on_custom

This repository contains a custom implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. These algorithms are implemented from scratch without using built-in machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Implement k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms from scratch.
2. Create a custom dataset containing images of two distinct classes: "Plant" and "Human."
3. Train and test both k-NN and SVM models on the custom image dataset.
4. Visualize the decision boundaries and predictions of both algorithms.
5. Compare the performance of k-NN and SVM in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability.

## Contents

- `KNN_on_custom.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for implementing k-NN and SVM on the custom dataset.
- `dataset/`: A directory containing the custom dataset with subfolders "Plant" and "Human."
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KNN_on_custom.git
